so here's the story:

yesterday, i compiled a list of tasks needed to be tackled immediately 4 one of the projects i worked on few months ago and which apparently needed tiding up

the first task i decided to work on was a simple page with a red logo on a black background. as always i decided to take this as an opportunity to learn something new and implement the thing using [snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/) which i've been wanting to try 4 quite a while now.  

the idea was to have simple svg animation that would trigger off on hover/click and which would see three "arms" of my red logo disperse in "snake/worm" style in different directions

as i set off to work on this i decided to run alongside my usual Brackets one of cloud based IDE's that you can find on chrome store which is just one of my saturday-morning-fun-kind-of-things. 

i hit the first one i came across which happened to be [Page Editey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-editey/fdiihdoehkilpfajkfmahgdiodppbajm) which comes with few templates to start with but since i wasn't really bothered i quickly went for "HTML only" option and kicked it off.

once the editor finished initialising my new workspace i realised the template was not an empty html file at all but it contained a lot of mark up. i run the code in the separate tab just to see how the preview works and ... my jaw hit the ground!
